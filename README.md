# DLND-DCGAN-face-generation

### Face Generation: Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.

You'll be using two datasets in this project: MNIST and CelebA. Since the celebA dataset is complex and you're doing GANs in a project for the first time, we want you to test your neural network on MNIST before CelebA. Running the GANs on MNIST will allow you to see how well your model trains sooner.
